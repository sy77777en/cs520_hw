PROMPT FOR TEST GENERATION: find_Product
=========================================

Based on the following formal specifications for find_Product(arr, n) -> int, generate pytest unit tests.

CORRECTED SPECIFICATIONS:

1. If all elements appear more than once, result is 1
   ```python
   unique_count = sum(1 for elem in set(arr) if arr.count(elem) == 1)
   assert (unique_count == 0 and res == 1) or (unique_count > 0)
   ```

2. Result is product of elements that appear exactly once
   ```python
   unique_elems = tuple(elem for elem in set(arr) if arr.count(elem) == 1)
   if len(unique_elems) == 0:
       assert res == 1
   else:
       product = 1
       for elem in unique_elems:
           product *= elem
       assert res == product
   ```

3. If array is empty, result is 1
   ```python
   assert (len(arr) > 0) or (res == 1)
   ```

4. If array contains zero and zero appears once, result is 0
   ```python
   assert (0 not in arr) or (arr.count(0) != 1) or (res == 0)
   ```

5. Result sign depends on count of negative unique elements
   ```python
   unique_elems = tuple(elem for elem in set(arr) if arr.count(elem) == 1)
   if len(unique_elems) > 0 and 0 not in unique_elems:
       neg_count = sum(1 for elem in unique_elems if elem < 0)
       if neg_count % 2 == 0:
           assert res > 0
       else:
           assert res < 0
   elif 0 in unique_elems and arr.count(0) == 1:
       assert res == 0
   ```

REQUIREMENTS:

Generate pytest test functions that validate these specifications. Each test should:
- Test one or more specific specifications
- Include a descriptive docstring explaining what it validates
- Use meaningful test names (e.g., test_spec1_all_duplicates_returns_one)
- Follow pytest conventions
- Use @pytest.mark.spec_guided decorator
- Be organized in a class called TestFindProductSpecGuided

EXPECTED OUTPUT FORMAT:
```python
import pytest
from src.find_product import find_Product

class TestFindProductSpecGuided:
    @pytest.mark.spec_guided
    def test_spec1_[name](self):
        """Docstring explaining what this tests"""
        # test code here
    
    # ... more tests
```
