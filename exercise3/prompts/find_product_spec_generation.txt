PROMPT FOR SPECIFICATION GENERATION: find_Product
=================================================

Problem description: Write a function to find the product of the unique elements in a given list. The function takes in a list and the length of the list, and should return the product of all elements that appear exactly once in the list. If there are no unique elements, return 1.

Method signature: def find_Product(arr, n) -> int

Please write formal specifications as Python assertions that describe the correct behavior of this method. Let 'res' denote the expected return value of 'find_Product(arr, n)'.

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:
- Do not call 'find_Product()' in your assertions (no self-reference)
- Do not use methods with side effects such as:
  * print, file I/O operations
  * random number generation
  * timing functions (datetime.now(), time.time())
  * data structure modifications (list.append(), dict[key] = value, set.add())
- Express the relationship between 'arr', 'n', and 'res' using pure arithmetic and boolean logic only
- You may use built-in immutable operations like arr.count(), set(arr), len(arr), tuple comprehensions
- Generate about 5 specifications as assertions

EXPECTED OUTPUT FORMAT:
```python
# Specification 1: [Description]
assert [condition]

# Specification 2: [Description]
assert [condition]

# ... etc
```

Generate the specifications now.
