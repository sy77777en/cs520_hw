PROMPT FOR SPECIFICATION GENERATION: prime_fib
==============================================

Problem description: Return the n-th number that is both a Fibonacci number and prime. The Fibonacci sequence is defined as F(0)=0, F(1)=1, and F(n)=F(n-1)+F(n-2) for n>1. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

Method signature: def prime_fib(n: int) -> int

Please write formal specifications as Python assertions that describe the correct behavior of this method. Let 'res' denote the expected return value of 'prime_fib(n)'.

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:
- Do not call 'prime_fib()' in your assertions (no self-reference)
- Do not use methods with side effects such as:
  * print, file I/O operations
  * random number generation
  * timing functions (datetime.now(), time.time())
  * data structure modifications (list.append(), dict assignment, set.add())
- Express the relationship between 'n' and 'res' using pure arithmetic and boolean logic only
- Generate about 5 specifications as assertions

EXPECTED OUTPUT FORMAT:
```python
# Specification 1: [Description]
assert [condition]

# Specification 2: [Description]
assert [condition]

# ... etc
```

Generate the specifications now.
