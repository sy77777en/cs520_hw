PRIME_FIB - Generated Specifications (Before Correction)
Generated by LLM from natural language description
"""

# These assertions are BEFORE manual correction
# Some contain errors that need to be fixed

# Specification 1: Result must be greater than 1 (all primes are > 1)
# Status: CORRECT
# assert res > 1


# Specification 2: Result must be prime (no divisors between 2 and sqrt(res))
# Status: CORRECT
# assert all(res % k != 0 for k in range(2, int(res**0.5) + 1))


# Specification 3: Result must be in Fibonacci sequence
# Status: INCORRECT - Uses list mutation (append) which is a side effect
# Problem: The fib_seq.append() method modifies a data structure
# fib_seq = [0, 1]
# while fib_seq[-1] < res:
#     fib_seq.append(fib_seq[-1] + fib_seq[-2])
# assert res in fib_seq


# Specification 4: For n >= 1, result must be at least 2
# Status: CORRECT
# assert (n < 1) or (res >= 2)


# Specification 5: Result must increase with n
# Status: INCORRECT - References prev_res which requires calling the function
# Problem: This creates self-reference by needing prime_fib(n-1)
# assert n == 1 or res > prev_res  # where prev_res = prime_fib(n-1)


# ACCURACY RATE: 3/5 = 60%
# Correct: Specifications 1, 2, 4
# Incorrect: Specifications 3, 5
