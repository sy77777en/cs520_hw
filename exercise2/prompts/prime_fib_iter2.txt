Coverage now 85% line, 78% branch after adding helper function tests.

Remaining uncovered areas:
- Early loop iterations in Fibonacci generation
- Count increment timing
- Sequence correctness validation

Generate tests that:
1. Verify sequential calls produce consistent results
2. Validate that results are actually in the Fibonacci sequence
3. Test with larger n values (n > 7)
4. Confirm both primality AND Fibonacci membership

Provide complete test functions.
